## WebExtension for Google Chrome / Firefox

Automatically removes the twitter login wall, added in August 2021.

Perfectly renders the "Twitter experience while not logged" as it was prior to the login wall deployment.

User experience has been extensively tested and is guaranteed to be comfortable. The login invite overlay is gone for good and will never flash to your eyes.

Finally, the extension is completely free of any "buy me a beer", "buy me a coffee" or any similar demand for sponsoring. It just embarks the bare minimum to remove the twitter login wall deployment in an optimal, fluid way. You using it is enough of a retribution for me.
