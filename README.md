## WebExtension for Google Chrome / Firefox

Automatically removes the twitter login wall, added in August 2021.

Perfectly renders the "Twitter experience while not logged" as it was prior to the login wall deployment.

User experience has been extensively tested and is guaranteed to be comfortable. The login invite overlay is gone for good and will never flash to your eyes.

Finally, the extension is completely free of any "buy me a beer", "buy me a coffee" or any similar demand for sponsoring. It just embarks the bare minimum to remove the twitter login wall deployment in an optimal, fluid way. You using it is enough of a retribution for me.

## Status

**02/21/2022: REFUSED** by the Chrome Web Store üò° for ["facilitation of unauthorized access to content on websites..."](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/#prohibited-products)

**02/25/2022: ACCEPTED** as a [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/defeat-twitter-forced-login/) üòÉ

**[01/23/2023: TWITTER LOGIN WALL IS GONE !](https://www.jamesxli.com/2022/11/22/geohot-is-here-to-remove-twitter-login-wall/)** As a result, this extension becomes almost pointless since Twitter now *suggests* user login with a "soft" closeable popup instead of forcing it with a hard popup that doesn't go away and prevents using the platform.

<span style="color:red">*I therefore recommend that users of this extension either disable or remove it.*</span>

This is because I can't guarantee that it blends well with the new Twitter UX and won't invest any time to find out (until Twitter brings back the login wall again, consider this project not to be under active development).

In the meantime, I'd like to thank the consistent 30+ users who trusted me with their Twitter experience for almost a year üòÅ
